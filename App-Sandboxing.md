# App sandboxing

Here are some ideas of how to sandbox an application.

### Separate user
The simplest way to sandbox an app is to run it as a separate user in your operating system.

### Virtualization
This takes a little more time to setup but is safer. You can use tools such as `VirtualBox` or `lxc` to create virtual machines.
