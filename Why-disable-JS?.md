In the past decades, Javascript has played a key role in shaping the internet. From simple interactions (such as "Like", "Upvote", "Reply") to apps and games distributed on the internet, they have been made possible thanks to Javascript.

(Javascript is a general purpose language that is also being used on the server side these days, but here, we use `Javascript` to mean Javascript running inside a user's browser)

Javascript is essentially remote code running inside the browser. What makes it especially powerful, and dangerous, is that the remote party can update their Javascript without active participation of the user.

## Attacks possible through Javascript
