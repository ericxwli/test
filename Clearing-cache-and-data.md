`gngr` stores all data (cookies, caches, preferences) inside the `.gngr` directory which is placed in the user's home directory.

To clear all persistent data, just remove the `.gngr` directory.

Currently, there is no way to clear data from within the app. We have an [open issue for it](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/issues/25).
